The profiler and and dynamic partitioner for offloading

Steps for installing line Profiler:
1. Install mercurial (Skip this step if using Official line_profiler from rkern)

1
sudo apt-get install mercurial
Note: rkernâ€™s Official line_profiler has recently added Python3 support in 1.0 release

2. Clone the line_profiler repository

Update:

1
git clone https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler.git
Note: The old repo was moved from BitBucket link to GitHub link

You can directly jump to Step 3 now, as Python3 support is provided by rkernâ€™s line_profiler ðŸ™‚

Note: If this doesnâ€™t work for you properly (Seems that they have kept support for 3.x on hold for now). You can clone this repository which is a fork of the above with 3.x compatibility.

1
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/kmike/line_profiler
or you can clone this one too:

1
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/thefalcon/line_profiler
3. Navigate into the line_profiler clone folder

1
cd line_profiler
4. Now you need to Install Cython (for python) / Cython3 (for python 3.x)

1
2
sudo apt-get install cython
sudo apt-get install cython3
5. Install line_profiler by running:

a) line_profiler for python
1
python setup.py install
b) line_profiler for python3

1
python3 setup.py install
6. Go to the folder where your .py file is located and run the following command:

1
kernprof.py -l example.py; python3 -m line_profiler example.py
